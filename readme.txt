<strong>1. How can I place the Like Button inside the post/page content using a shortcode?</strong>

Use the following shortcode: `[likebtn]`

You can pass Like Button settings as parameters in the shortcode:
`[likebtn identifier="my_button_in_post" style="large"]`

If identifier parameter is not specified, post ID is used.


<strong>2. How can I display a list of the most liked content inside the post/page using a shortcode? (PRO, VIP, ULTRA)</strong>

Use the following shortcode:
`[likebtn_most_liked content_types="post,comment" title="Most liked posts and comments on my website" show_date="1" show_likes="0" show_dislikes="1" number="3"]`

Available content types: `post, page, attachment, revision, nav_menu_item, comment` and custom post types.


<strong>3. Identifier structure.</strong>

The `idenfitifer` parameter in WordPress LikeBtn plugin has the following structure: **Post type** + **_** + **Post ID**

Examples: post_1, page_7

So if you need to insert the LikeBtn HTML-code directly into WordPress post template, you can specify `identifier`-parameter as follows:
`data-identifier="post_<?php the_ID()?>"`
